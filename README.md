# Java-ScreenCapture
An experimental and lightweight Java utility to take screenshots and upload them to a server via FTP for sharing online

This project uses the Apache Commons FTP library. 

This is very much a bare-bones solution to taking and sharing screenshots online. There is very little in ways of both error checking and error reporting, it should therefore not be used without a lot of alteration. This is more of a proof-of-concept and to get the general idea across.
